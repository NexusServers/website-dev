        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What makes Nexus Servers different from other game hosting providers?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Unlike budget hosts that oversell their hardware, Nexus Servers uses enterprise-grade NVMe SSDs and DDR5 RAM with strict resource allocation. This means your server gets 100% of the allocated resources, resulting in consistently smooth gameplay even during peak hours.</p>
                <p>We also own and operate our hardware in Reno, Nevada, giving us complete control over quality and performance. Most importantly, our support team consists of actual gamers who understand exactly what you need for a great hosting experience.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How quickly can I get my game server online?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>All Nexus game servers are instantly deployed after payment. You'll receive login credentials within 30 seconds, and most game servers can be fully configured and online within 2-5 minutes using our one-click installers.</p>
                <p>For Minecraft, Terraria, and other supported games, we offer pre-configured templates that can have you playing with friends almost immediately after purchase.</p>

            <h3>Do you offer custom control panels for different games?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes! Each game on Nexus Servers has a specialized control panel designed for that specific game. For example, our Minecraft panel includes one-click plugin installers, while our Rust panel features automatic wipe scheduling and oxide management.</p>
                <p>All of our game servers use the Pterodactyl panel as a base, which provides an intuitive, modern interface for managing your server files, console, and settings.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Absolutely! You can easily upgrade your game server at any time through our client area. Our upgrade process preserves all your game data, configurations, and world files.</p>
                <p>Many customers start with a smaller plan and upgrade as their community grows. We make this process seamless so your players experience minimal downtime during the transition.</p>
